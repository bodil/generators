Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there came an era
when the ideals of friendship gave way to greed, selfishness, paranoia
and a jealous reaping of dwindling space and natural resources. Lands
took up arms against their neighbors. The end of the world occurred
much as we had predicted â€” the world was plunged into an abyss of
balefire and dark magic.
